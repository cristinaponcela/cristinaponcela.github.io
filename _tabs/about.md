### Hello! 

My name is Cristina Poncela Cubeiro. I am a mathematician and avid coder. 

I am originally from Spain, but studied university in the UK and ever since have been moving around from country to country. I have lived in Italy, India and currently Uzbekistan, where I am learning my fourth language, Russian. I love the beach, travelling and gymming.

I learned how to code in the summer of 2023, and kind of stumbled into it. I have built an application in React-Native, 2 applications in Flutter, and a Computer Vision Machine Learning model in TensorFlow. I also have experience in Python, and have built several websites (both from scratch or otherwise). Now I work as a Software Engineer for Bending Spoons, in a team called AI Videography, where I work mainly on StreamYard, but also Streamable and Splice.
