We're back with another Weaving Change/ Swerv post! I'm really excited to finally be writing these - this project was definitely pivotal in my career. I arrived with no experienc and barely having a clue of how to code, and I left as a Software Engineer. As I mentioned in the previous post, I spent 9 months working on this project. Out of these, the first 2.5 were spent on ClothingCAT (the ML model), then 2.5 were spent off since I was sitting my final university exams and then went on a sick trip around China and Japan (yey!), and the final 4 were spent as a Full-Stack Developer getting the application ready for the launch on November 16th.
